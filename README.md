# Mechaxil ‚Äî Docs & Open Hardware Hub

This repo powers our documentation website, built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (with a little bit of custom code), a modern static site generator. It‚Äôs fast, simple, and perfect for open hardware docs.

## What is Mechaxil?

Mechaxil is a hobby-electronics store + documentation site. We build and curate open-source projects, publish guides, and offer affordable kits and parts. We‚Äôre a tiny team, so contributions (docs, fixes, examples) help a ton ‚Äî and yes, grabbing parts from our [webshop](https://mechaxil.com/) supports the mission ‚ù§Ô∏è

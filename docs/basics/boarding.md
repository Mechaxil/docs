## 3-step Quick Start (do this first)

1. **Read the safety bits** — open the Project Overview and scan the “Warnings” section.
2. **Check the BOM** — compare the parts you bought with the project BOM (Solar or Smart-Ag etc.). Get any missing safety gear (fuses, protection PCB, enclosure, safety gloves, glasses) before powering up.
3. **Power it up, safely** — assemble in a dry workspace, add fuses, connect PV last. Run the basic commissioning tests in the Testing doc.

## Safety — read this first
- **Always** use a protected Li‑ion cell or a protection PCB with raw cells.  
- Use fuses on PV and battery lines.  
- Verify PV Voc ≤ the controller max (24 V for Waveshare).  
- Do the commissioning checklist in the docs before leaving it unattended.

## Where to get help
- **Discord**: join our community for real-time help [Discord](https://discord.gg/CecTK8quUc). Post photos and measurements — that speeds troubleshooting.  
- **Webshop / Item DB**: open a support ticket if a part is wrong or missing.  
- **GitHub**: report issues on the repo for docs or firmware.  
- **Email**: ```zavoczkiattila@mechaxil.com``` .

When asking for help, include: your SKU list, photos of wiring, battery voltage, PV Voc, and the module LEDs/status.

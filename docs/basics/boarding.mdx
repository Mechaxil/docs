# Getting Started — Quick Overview

Welcome — this is the quick boarding page for you who found us from the webshop, socials, or somewhere else and want to get into a quick headstart in some of your projects.

If you landed here: nice. This page gets you set up fast, points to the project docs, shows what to buy, and where to get help.

## Features

First thing to familiarize yourself is how the documentation works, we implemented a few unique features to docusaurus (this entire page is based on it),
- The most useful one is **<GlossaryTerm term="Tooltips without links" />** and **<GlossaryTerm term="Tooltips with links" />** the later usually serves as an easy 
way to access a part of documentation or product on the webshop,
- The other feature is a list of materials used for the project ( **<GlossaryTerm term="BOM" />** ) such as this:

<Checklist 
project="boarding"
items={[
    "Creativity",
    "Willingness to learn",
    "Fun",
]} storageKey="shopping-list" />

## Who this is for

## 3-step Quick Start

1. **Read the safety bits** — Always scan the “Warnings” section first before proceeding with anything.
2. **Check the BOM** — compare the parts you bought with the project BOM (Solar or Smart-Ag etc.). Get any missing safety gear (fuses, protection PCB, enclosure, safety gloves, glasses) before powering up.
3. **Power it up, safely** — assemble in a dry workspace, add fuses, connect PV last. Run the basic commissioning tests in the Testing doc.

## Safety
- **Always** use safety gear especially if using Li‑ion cells and other dangerous items, a proper safety gear contains:
    - Glasses
    - Gloves
    - Good ventillation (especially when soldering)
- Do the commissioning checklist in the docs before leaving it unattended.

## Where to get help
- **Discord**: join our community for real-time help [Discord](https://discord.gg/CecTK8quUc). Post photos and measurements — that speeds troubleshooting.  
- **Webshop / Item DB**: open a support ticket if a part is wrong or missing.  
- **GitHub**: report issues on the repo for docs or firmware.  
- **Email**: ```zavoczkiattila@mechaxil.com``` .

When asking for help, include: your SKU list, photos of wiring, battery voltage, PV Voc, and the module LEDs/status.

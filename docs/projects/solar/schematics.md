# Schematics (placeholder)

**Placeholder file:** `schematics/solar_v1.pdf`

Suggested schematic sections (create and export as PDF/SVG):

1. PV array configuration (series/parallel) → PV fuse → SPD → Waveshare PV+
2. Battery: 18650 protected pack → Waveshare BAT+/BAT- (show polarity)
3. Waveshare outputs → buck / 5 V / 3.3 V rails → Pico / ESP32
4. Load switching: MOSFET driver (D4184‑M) → solenoid with diode across coil
5. Safety: fuses, blocking diode, grounding points

**TODO:** Upload `schematics/solar_v1.pdf` to `docs/solar/schematics/` and replace this placeholder with embedded image or link.

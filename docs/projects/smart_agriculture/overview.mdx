A low-power, field-ready irrigation and monitoring controller. Uses an **<GlossaryTerm term="ESP32" />** for control, capacitive soil moisture sensing, and a 12V solenoid valve to control water. Designed to run from a small solar (see Solar Project docs).

**Goals**
- Automatic, moisture-based irrigation with scheduling
- Local fail-safe behavior (valve closes on comms loss or critical battery)
- Low-power operation with accurate sensor calibration
- Simple telemetry (MQTT/HTTP) and OTA updates via ESP32-C3

**Warnings**
- Protect electronics from water and condensation — use IP-rated enclosures and cable glands.
- Use protected Li-ion cells and fuses on power rails.
- For underground or potted deployments, avoid sensors in standing water for long periods.
